[HOSTING]
Guide on how to host your own server.

-= Quick host =-

Quick host a server by using third party services like Radmin VPN or Hamachi.

1. Download an app that can work.

2. Create a network and make sure everyone that wants to play is in it

3. Copy the IPV4 of the hoster

4. In-game, add a server using the IPV4 and the port 50001.

-= Port forwading =-

Port forwading allows hosting without use of any service plus reducing greatly reducing latency.

1. Open CMD ( Windows console ) and type ipconfig / press Windows + R and type ipconfig.

2. Search for your Ethernet default gateway, copy that number and paste on your web browser.

3. To port forward you might need a password, usually you can find these on top or on bottom of your router, if not you might have to contact your internet provider.

4. Search for "port forward" option, and then add a new rule, you can name it however you want.

5. To setup the port forwad, if you not sure what protocol to use you might just select TCP/UDP, for Multiplayer Mod use UDP.

6. Use the game port ( 50001 ) as both internal and external port.

7. On CMD, search for your Ethernet IPV4, then paste it on your Internal IP. *It is not recommended to publish your Internal IPV4 since people can use it to cause DOS attacks and such other things*

8. After that, just save the rule and you are able to host, but, in order to people to directly join, they need your public IPV4, which you can find in :
https://www.myip.com/

9. Copy your public IP and give it to your friends.

You won't have any problem sharing your public IP, but do not share your Internal IP.

Be aware that your IP changes regularly, and usually you have to pay in order to make it static, but there is a free workaround for it, which you can find on google.

10. Start server.exe
